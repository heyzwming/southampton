We are a group of University of Southampton students designing and building an open-source autonomous sailing robot. Our ultimate goal is to develop a sustainable sailing platform that used for long distance, low-cost oceanographic survey. Find more updates on our work on [our blog](https://blog.sotonsailrobot.org/) and [hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/13096-southampton-sailing-robot)



## Getting Start 

You can try our code in [simulator](Simulator) with your own computer (if you have never used ROS before you can learn some of its basics capabilities with the [simulator challenge](Simulator-challenge)).
 
When you are happy with your code, you can test those code with [real hardware](https://github.com/Maritime-Robotics-Student-Society/sailing-robot/wiki/Electronic-hardware-list). 

This wiki page includes documents on software and electronics. Hardware and boat construction guidance are available on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/13096-southampton-sailing-robot).


## Feedback and troubleshooting
