We are happy to share our voyage log at [here](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~yc6n13/sailing-robot/). Bag files are raw data recorded by ROS, CSV file contains GPS coordinates of each tests, and JSON file includes parameter file used for each test. 

We will upload sample images for obstacle avoidance soon.
